# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer
`addBostonToFavorites` is not a pure function as it is directly changing the array of `favoriteLocations` by adding to it. In other words, there is a side effect. However, if a copy was made of `favoriteLocations`, then `addBostonToFavorites` would become a pure function as the original array would still remain unchanged.
