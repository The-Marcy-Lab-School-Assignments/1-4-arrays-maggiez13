# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
When passing `name` through the `changeName` function, we are passing a copy of its value, not the reference as the variable is a string type. Inside the function, we are modifying the copy (`nameToChange`) instead of the original variable (`name`). Therefore, `name` will remain unchanged. 

However, arrays (part of objects) are passed by reference. Therefore, when we pass `favoriteLocations` to the `addBostonToFavorites` function, we are passing a reference to the original array. Thus, when modifying the array inside the function, we are also modifying the original array as well, resulting in a change of `favoriteLocations`.
